Greetings, my name is por_quez I'm a beginner in python and I'm making a game to vasten my knowledge with python. 
In this game(Slitherin escapees!) you will be locked in a basement and given attempts and options to escape. Different options will have different results.
The game is made for people of older age, who enjoy games under time stress and using your brain.
Have fun with this game and I'd enjoy any feedback, contact me on discord if so. por_quez, enjoy!
